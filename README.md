### pptScanner.py
Allows for rapid scanning of entire directories of power point files to locate specific strings in the slides. Good for studying! It's called from command line with the syntax: 

./pptScanner.py [searchterm] [directory] [recurse?]

if the recurse argument exists, it will scan all child directories as well
